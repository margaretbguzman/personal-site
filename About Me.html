          <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>
            I grew up and attended school in Santa Clara, CA. I spent the last two years of high school in the Mission Middle College Program, now known as Mission Early College High School.
            For one year after graduating from Santa Clara High School, I attended West Valley College and transferred my credits to San Francisco State University. I graduated SFSU
            magna cum laude with a BS in nutrition/dietetics.
